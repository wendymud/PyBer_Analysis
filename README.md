### PyBer_Analysis Overview

Utilizing Python and Pandas, the task was to first sift through and clean PyBer's ride sharing data to prepare for an analysis.  Then, with 
that data, segment it into several data frames, identifying the types of city areas (urban, susburban, rural), obtaining the average cost 
per fare, total fare, driver averages, and constructing a comprehensive final chart, depicting the different ride-sharing in types of areas as
well as comparing fares for the different months of the year.  This summary will allow decision-makers to obtain better predictibility and
possibly look to make improvements as a result of the data provided.
